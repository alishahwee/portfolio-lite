      <h3>You <em>can</em> teach an old dog new tricks.</h3>
      <p>
        My career path was a bit unconventional. I spent four years pursuing and
        ultimately obtaining a bachelors degree. I had always possessed an
        interest in programming, however I never pursued it due to a fear that I
        would not succeed, and that hesitation led myself to a field I did not
        have an affinity for. Following graduation I began working and quickly
        felt as if I had made the wrong career choice. I was lost. This field
        did not provide me with the fulfillment I craved so dearly for in a
        career. There was little growth, and I knew a career change was
        imminent.
      </p>
      <p>
        It took nearly a year after graduating college to discover that
        programming truly was my passion. I began coding and became hooked after
        the first week. This field provided me with all the career related
        elements that I longed for: problem solving, continuous learning,
        tech-involvement, collaboration, and public service. Most importantly, I
        wanted to be a part of the future. My goal was to utilize my skills and
        and provide services that could directly impact the community going
        forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, after several months of actively practicing coding and programming,
        I can officially say that I have completely cemented myself into this
        field. I took control of my future, and I cannot be happier and more
        excited to see where the journey leads.

                  Earned a third certificate from freeCodeCamp finishing my web

              <p>
                As a self-starter and devoted learner, the journey to software
                engineer is not one that gets shorter, but will always be
                infinite. It is only expected that this timeline will continue
                to grow for as long as I live. And that is quite alright with
                me.
